# Deploying a Contract on StarkNet

This repository contains the necessary steps to deploy a Cairo-written contract on the StarkNet network, specifically on Sepolia.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [ScarB](https://github.com/starknet-io/scarb) (for compiling Cairo contracts)
- [Starkli](https://github.com/argentlabs/starkli) (tool for interacting with the StarkNet network)

## Deployment Steps

1. **Compile the Contract**:
   Compile your Cairo-written contract with the following command:

   ```bash
   scarb build
   ```

   This will generate the contract's `.json` file, which will be used for deployment.

2. **Declare the Contract**:
   Declare your contract on the StarkNet network (Sepolia) using the `starkli declare` command. Make sure to replace the path to the file generated in the previous step:

   ```bash
   starkli declare ./target/dev/contracts_ERC20.contract_class.json --strk --network=sepolia
   ```

   Copy the `class hash` generated by the above command. This will be required for the next step.

3. **Deploy the Contract**:
   With the copied `class hash`, proceed to deploy the contract using the following command:

   ```bash
   starkli deploy --strk 0x02d3de508269dcdd7cc2d6b76c3b20d2c1b9069d7fa7d5f96c6956843cee8494
   ```

   Replace the `class hash` in the command with the value obtained in the previous step.
